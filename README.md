## ðŸš€ Usage Guide

### **Fetching Tasks**

Tasks are fetched from the API when the app loads. If offline, tasks will be loaded from local storage (`AsyncStorage`).

### **Adding a Task**

- If online, the task is sent to the API.
- If offline, the task is stored locally and marked as `offline: true`.

### **Updating Task Status**

- If online, the update request is sent to the API.
- If offline, the update is stored locally and applied when reconnected.

### **Deleting a Task**

- If online, the delete request is sent to the API.
- If offline, the task is removed locally and deleted from the server when reconnected.

### **Offline Task Synchronization**

When the internet connection is restored, offline tasks are automatically:

1. Sent to the API.
2. Removed from local storage after successful synchronization.
3. Merged with the latest server data to avoid data loss.
